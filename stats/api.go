// Package stats defines a statistics acquisition and monitoring API
// which uses the go 'expvar' API as the underlying representation mechanism.
//
// The main difference between this API and the raw expvar API are the following:
//
// - this API does not leak memory if an unbounded number of short-lived Statistics objects are
//   created. Naive use of the expvar Map API for the same purpose is not well-suited
//   to this task because that API does not have a Delete method. There are ways to
//   workaround the issue, but they are somewhat complex and kludgy.
// - since Recorder Add/Set methods write directly into pre-allocated expvar Vars referenced
//   by go maps that never change, minimal locking is required in the recording path.
// - the Statistics objects created by this API are not directly reachable with a walk of the
//   expvar tree. Instead, a 'walk' function is provided which permits iteration over
//   the current set of statistics.
//
// In addition a View mechanism permits a background thread that is periodically polling
// the Registry of Statistics to see the last update made to a set of Statistics since
// the last polling cycle, even if the recording thread has closed the associated
// Recorder in the intervening time. This is achieved with a reference counting mechanism
// which ensures that a Statistics objects is not removed from the View until
// the consumer of the View has "seen" the Close event.
//
// The Recorder interface is a facade that manages the construction of expvar Map objects and
// their members - once the Recorder is initialised, the programmer has a single interface to
// interact which is simpler to understand than the several different types that one has
// to juggle with the raw expvar API. For example:
//
//    recorder.SetInt("level", int64(1))
//
// is easier to code and read, than:
//
//    r := expvar.Int{}
//    r.Set(int64(1))
//    m.Set("level", r)
//
// The Recorder interface exposes Set and Add methods that allow lock-free access
// to slices of the underlying expvar Map variables and a Close() method that can be used
// by the described object to release resources associated with the Recorder and remove
// the Statistics object from any open Views.
//
// In code:
//
//     foo.stats := stats.Root.
//        NewBuilder("cpu:1", "cpu", map[string]string{"tag": "T"}). // stats.Builder
//        DeclareInt("counter",0).                          // stats.Builder
//        MustBuild().                                      // stats.Built
//        Open()                                            // stats.Recorder
//
//
// During the lifetime of the foo object:
//
//     foo.stats.AddInt("counter", 1)
//
// Some time later, when foo is closed:
//
//     foo.stats.Close()
//
// The API is designed so that consumers of Statistics objects get exactly
// the interface they need to perform the task their role requires and no more.
//
// For example, consider the life cycle of a Statistics object.
//
// A Statistics object starts out as a Builder, obtained from stats.Root.NewBuilder(),
// by the object it describes - the so-called 'described object'. The described object then configures
// the Builder by declaring which statistics will be written into the Recorder when the
// Recorder becomes live. Once the declarations are finished, the described object calls
// MustBuild() to obtain a reference to a frozen interface of type Built. Assuming this
// call succeeds, the caller then invokes the Built.Open() method to simultaneously
// register, and obtain a reference to, the Recorder interface that will be used during the
// lifetime of the described object. The Recorder interface is only used by 'described objects'; observers
// of the statistics Registry only see instances of Statistics, an interface which does not
// include methods that allow the mutation or closing of the underlying Recorder object.
//
